# Robot Rockstars 🎸🤖

A five-week youth robotics bootcamp that takes beginners from a box of LEGO to a competition-ready
robot for the **WRO 2026 RoboMission Elementary** season (*"Robot Rockstars"*), on **LEGO SPIKE
Prime programmed in Python with [Pybricks](https://pybricks.com/)**.

**▶ The course portal is the thing to look at: <https://naifmersal.github.io/WRO-LEGO-pybricks/>** —
a card grid of all 25 sessions, each opening a reveal.js deck, plus the recap arcade and the field
tool.

## 📦 What is in this repository

| Path | What it is |
|:--|:--|
| `index.qmd` | The kid-facing landing page — the card grid of all 25 sessions. |
| `slides/` | One reveal.js deck per curriculum day, named by **topic**, never by day number. `slides/README.md` is the day → deck map. |
| `library-cheatsheet.qmd` | Every verb the students own, on one page. Handed out at D5. |
| `interactives/` | Hand-written standalone HTML the decks link or iframe: the Recap Arcade (master + its two generated sittings) and the Beam Balance catch-up lab. |
| `code/` | The four gold-reference Pybricks programs the cheat sheet offers as downloads — `movements.py`, `claw_gripper.py`, `lift_gripper.py`, `grip_test.py`. |
| `tools/odommap/` | Vendored field measuring tool (see attribution below), used coach-side for route planning and student-facing in the path-planning session. |
| `slides_template/` | Shared branding and the deck scaffold: SCSS theme, logo, splash filter. |
| `handouts/` | Printables. |

**One layout rule:** repo root = Quarto site pages · `slides/` = reveal decks · `interactives/` =
hand-written standalone HTML. Put a new page in the matching place and list it in `_quarto.yml` if
it is not a `.qmd`.

## 🚫 What is not here, and why

This repo is public, so it carries the **site sources only**. The coach side is kept out
deliberately, and `.gitignore` enforces it:

- **The planning documents** — the bootcamp plan, the decision log, the robot specs, the WRO rules.
  They are the working record of a live cohort and are not distributed. Decks and READMEs still
  cite them by path (`docs/…`); those references will not resolve in a clone.
- **Student data** — photographs, names, exam scripts and marks. The students are children.
- **The Skills Check** — the exam page, its answer key, the Apps Script endpoint and the results.
  The exam page is generated coach-side and opened from disk on the day; it is **not** published,
  and must never be added to `resources:` in `_quarto.yml`.
- **The rest of `tools/`** — the Brython bench simulator, the route optimiser, the spec extractor.

If you are the coach and you are looking for those, they are on your own disk, not in this history.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Hardware** — LEGO SPIKE Prime Core Set (45678) + Expansion Set (45681).
- **Firmware** — [Pybricks](https://pybricks.com/), which replaces the SPIKE Hub OS with
  MicroPython + the Pybricks API. Flash it once per hub, then write code in the
  [Pybricks Code Editor](https://code.pybricks.com/).
- **Site build** — [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) ≥ 1.8.26.

```bash
quarto preview          # live-reload the whole site
quarto render           # build into output/
quarto preview index.qmd   # just the portal
```

`output/` is generated and ignored; the built site is published to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 📐 Domain invariants

Constraints that recur through every deck and must not drift:

1. **Robot limits (WRO General Rules §5).** ≤ 250 × 250 × 250 mm at the start · ≤ 1.5 kg · one
   controller hub · **no wireless link between components** (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi off, program
   downloaded by cable) · one physical start/stop button.
2. **The 4-motor cap binds before the port budget — and which one you mean matters.** The *stock*
   LEGO Education Advanced Driving Base fills all 6 hub ports (2 large drive + 2 medium tool motors
   + 2 colour sensors), leaving nothing for a distance sensor. **This build is not the stock kit:**
   it runs **one** colour sensor, so **port A is free** — while its four motors sit exactly at
   Elementary's **maximum of 4** (§5.2.8). Wall detection is by motor-stall detection and gyro
   heading, not by a distance sensor.
3. **Pedagogy — "break it → feel it → fix it".** Everything is delivered live in class, with no
   pre-work dependency. Open with a naive approach that fails visibly (open-loop drift), let the
   students feel the limitation, and introduce the technique as the rescue.
4. **Anchor-first scoring.** The foundation is the **~135-point anchor run with no colour sensing**
   (instruments 45 + cables 30 + bonus-by-avoidance 40 + microphone 20), and **~135 locked to ×20
   ≥ 90 % is the gated five-week deliverable**. The two fixed notes (+40 → ~175) are a **D24
   stretch** taken only after the lock passes; the four randomized notes (+80) and 255-point
   consistency open the continuation season. Never trade a reliable gated run for a shakier full
   one.
