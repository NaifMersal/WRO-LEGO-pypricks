"""lift_gripper.py -- jaws that GRIP an object, then LIFT it.  Port C.

    from movements import *
    import lift_gripper as lift       # named, NEVER star-imported

    lift.home()                       # shut on nothing = zero, then open ready
    lift.grab()                       # squeeze, then raise
    lift.release()                    # set down and open all the way
    lift.release(50)                  # ...or set down and open only THIS far

ONE MOTOR, ONE CONTINUOUS MOVE, TWO OUTCOMES. The jaws close until the object
stops them. Keep turning the same way and the jaws can't move any more -- so
the frame levers up around them instead, and the object rides up with it.

    +120 ........ contact ........ 0 ....... contact - LIFT_TRAVEL
    open, ready   object grips     jaws met  UP and carrying
                  VARIES BY SIZE   on air

PHASE 1 IS TORQUE, PHASE 2 IS ANGLE -- AND PHASE 2 COUNTS FROM CONTACT, NOT
FROM ZERO. A big base stops the jaws at +45, a small one at +20; an absolute
lift target would swing them to different heights. LIFT_TRAVEL is degrees
*past contact*, so every object rises the same amount.

POSITIVE OPENS, and zero is where the jaws MEET -- the same way round as
claw_gripper.py, so a sign means the same thing in both files.
