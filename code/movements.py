    robot.reset(angle=0)
    drive_straight(300)
    robot.turn(90, absolute=True)
    find_line()

RULES OF THE ROAD
    distances in mm         drive_straight(300) = 30 cm
    speeds in mm/s          drive_straight(300, speed=150)
    by, or to               robot.turn(90) spins 90 MORE.
                            robot.turn(90, absolute=True) FACES 90.

    Same idea as the claw: run_angle moves BY, run_target moves TO. One pair of
    words, two places on the robot.

ONE ZERO
    absolute=True aims at the zero robot.reset() set. Only TWO verbs move that
    zero, and both do it on purpose, because they just learnt the truth from the
    mat: wall_square() and square_on_line(). Nothing else may touch it -- a verb
    that moved the zero as a side effect would leave every later turn aiming at
    the wrong place, which is the bug that cost cohort 1 a fortnight.

    Both spend robot.reset(angle=h), which ALSO zeroes the distance odometer and
    stops the wheels. That is why every hunting verb below remembers its own
    start = robot.distance() instead of resetting.

THE VERBS THAT RUN THE ANCHOR
    drive_straight(mm)    forward, or backward if mm is negative
    find_line()           creep until the eye finds a line -- CHECK what it returns
    follow_line(mm)       ride the edge of the line this far (kd= for the PD stretch)
    drive_to_wall()       creep until the wheels stall on the border
    wall_square(h)        square up on the border and declare the heading
    square_on_line(h)     square up on a line and declare the heading -- TWO EYES

    Turning and heading are Pybricks' own: robot.turn() and robot.angle().
    show_eye() doesn't move the robot -- it lets you SEE what it thinks, which is
    how you tune. The two colour verbs at the foot of the file are STRETCH -- you
    score ~135 without ever naming a colour.

Everything you might change is in ROBOT FACTS, at the top.
Why any of this: docs/library-design-notes.md #1, #7, #8.
